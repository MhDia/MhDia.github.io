<h2>Peer and Authority Pressure in Information Propagation Models</h2>
<p>Existing models of information diffusion assume that peer influence is
the main reason for observed propagation patterns. In this work, we
examined the role of authority pressure on the observed information
cascades, by characterizing some nodes in the network as “authority”
nodes. In collaboration with my mentor, I developed a model that
associates every information item with two parameters that quantify the
impact of peer and authority pressure on its propagation. I then
implemented functions to learn these parameters given a network and the
observed diffusion patterns of the item, and characterize the item as
peer- or authority-propagated, by setting up and solving a convex
optimization problem. My advisor and I also developed a randomization
test that evaluates the statistical significance of our findings and
makes our item characterization robust to noise. I applied this method
to real data from online media and scientific-collaboration networks,
and found that there is a strong signal of authority pressure in these
networks. </p>

<h2>Graph-Agnostic Identification of Influence Relationships</h2>
<p>Although our work on peers and authorities assumed that peer
connections are known, this information is missing in many real
applications. For example, our Yahoo! collaborator pointed out that
Yahoo! knows the times when users clicked on an advertisement or adopted
a product but remains unaware of the social relationships amongst its
users. My current research focuses on identifying the roles of
individuals in a network without knowing the structure of the network
itself, and using the activation times of individuals with respect to
items as clues. This work is in collaboration with my mentor at Boston
University and Kun Liu, who is a research scientist at Yahoo!.</p>
<h2>Query by Humming</h2>
<p>Query-by-humming (QBH) enables users to identify a song by humming or
singing a section of it. While existing work and commercial applications
rely on a collection of query samples for each song in their database,
our approach does not require any training queries. My primary
contribution to this project was to define a new measure of edit
distance between two melodies that tolerates mistakes commonly made by
amateur singers. For example, many people shorten pauses in songs, and
sing slightly off tune, such that the difference in pitch between two
successive notes is accurate even if each note by itself is
off-key. Therefore, my edit distance measure penalizes such mistakes
less heavily. I also defined a multi-dimensional time series format in
which to represent both the library of songs (which consist of many
tracks, each corresponding to different instruments or vocals) and the
hummed queries (which only contain information about the notes hummed),
so that the two can be meaningfully compared. I implemented the above
metrics, as well as a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to convert a sung
query into a sequence of notes, to create a functioning query-by-humming
system. I also wrote a web crawler to create a large collection of test
queries, which I used to evaluate the accuracy of the system. </p>
