I am cofounder and CTO at [https://www.migacore.com Migacore Technologies], where we use NLP and AI to help travel companies understand changes in demand patterns. 


Before this, I worked at companies including Palantir Technologies (distributed databases), Google (natural language processing), and Groupon (personalization). 

My CV is available [GB-CV.pdf here].

== Research 

I am on leave from the PhD program in Computer Science at the [http://www.illinois.edu University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign], 
where I am a member of the [http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/ Data Mining Research Group] and advised by Professor [http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj/ Jiawei Han]. 

I graduated with my BA and MA degrees from Boston University in May 2012, 
where Professor [http://www.cs.bu.edu/~evimaria/ Evimaria Terzi] was my advisor. 

My research interests are in the general area of data management. In
particular, I am interested in the
design and development of algorithms for efficient data analysis and retrieval.
